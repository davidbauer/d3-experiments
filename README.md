d3-experiments
==============

As I go along learning D3.js, I'll be sharing some experiments. Inputs and corrections very welcome.

Current project:

:: Football transfer records, visualised ::

- Add labels to bars (transfer sum)
- Change input from checkbox to radio buttons or dropdown
- Use data from column "season" to indicate when transfers happened
- Add fromclub and toclub as mouseover info to bars
- Highlight a specific bar, <strikethrough>a) predefined = hardcoded,</strikethrough> b) based on input given by user, like "show all transfers to clubs in russia"
